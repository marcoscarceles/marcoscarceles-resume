Profile: Like most, I started my career following a passion for technology and building great products, applying the right technology to solve the right problem. Working in Sky News in UK, I discovered the profound impact that the right culture, team dynamics, and leadership can have. So, I shifted my focus to building great teams around empowered individuals. Having developed versatility balancing technical and leadership roles in companies of a very different nature and maturity, I broadened my scope to help multiple teams and engineering organizations grow and thrive.
